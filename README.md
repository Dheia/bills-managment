I am sick and tired of confusion with my bills. I receive emails that I have dept and overpayment from same company. One month I didn't know that rate was updated and I payed at the old rate. And I can not see history of tarif change to calibrate my payments.

And that why I want to keep all my bills in one place. But not only keep, but it must help me calculate amount I need to pay. In the beginning I want to manually type rate of some service(gas, light). But in future i want to parse this rate from corresponding service website
